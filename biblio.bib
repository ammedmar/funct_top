abstract = {We prove, correct and extend several results of an earlier paper of ours (using and recalling several of our later papers) about the derived functors of projective limit in abelian categories. In particular we prove that if C is an abelian category satisfying the Grothendieck axioms AB3 and AB4* and having a set of generators then the first derived functor of projective limit vanishes on so-called Mittag-Leffler sequences in C. The recent examples given by Deligne and Neeman show that the condition that the category has a set of generators is necessary. The condition AB4* is also necessary, and indeed we give for each integer m ⩾ 1 an example of a Grothendieck category Cm and a Mittag-Leffler sequence in Cm for which the derived functors of its projective limit vanish in all positive degrees except m. This leads to a systematic study of derived functors of infinite products in Grothendieck categories. Several explicit examples of the applications of these functors are also studied.},

abstract = {Topological persistence has proven to be a key concept for the study of real-valued functions defined over topological spaces. Its validity relies on the fundamental property that the persistence diagrams of nearby functions are close. However, existing stability results are restricted to the case of continuous functions defined over triangulable spaces. In this paper, we present new stability results that do not suffer from the above restrictions. Furthermore, by working at an algebraic level directly, we make it possible to compare the persistence diagrams of functions defined over different spaces, thus enabling a variety of new applications of the concept of persistence. Along the way, we extend the definition of persistence diagram to a larger setting, introduce the notions of discretization of a persistence module and associated pixelization map, define a proximity measure between persistence modules, and show how to interpolate between persistence modules, thereby lending a more analytic character to this otherwise algebraic setting. We believe these new theoretical concepts and tools shed new light on the theory of persistence, in addition to simplifying proofs and enabling new applications.},
