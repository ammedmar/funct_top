		\item Replaced as suggested (RAS), thank you.
		\item RAS, thank you.
		\item We did mean to ``functional analysis''. Thank you for the question.
		\item RAS, thank you.
		\item RAS, thank you.
		\item Before discussing more details of the stability result, including the concepts related to the metric theory of persistence modules we added the sentence:
		\begin{quote}
			We now provide more details regarding this result although they are not used in the present work.
		\end{quote}
		\item Definition moved as suggested.

		\item Replaced the preceding paragraph with:
		\begin{quote}
			In analogy to Morse's definitions, we may define, for an integer $d$ and real numbers $t$ and $\epsilon > 0$, the $(d, t, \epsilon)$-\emph{cap number} of our graded q-tame persistence module $M$ in terms of its persistence diagram as:
