% We introduce topological conditions on a broad class of filtered spaces ensuring that their associated persistent homology modules admit persistence diagrams, which, in particular, implies that they satisfy generalized Morse inequalities.
% We illustrate the applicability of these results by recasting the original proof of the Unstable Minimal Surface Theorem given by Morse and Tompkins in a modern and rigorous framework.

%% If title is "PH for functionals", I would suggest a rewrite of the abstract above along the following lines:
