\section{Homology theories} \label{s:homology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition (generalized homology theory, without dimension axiom, but with Milnor's additivity axiom)
\item Examples, main: singular with integer coeff and cech with field \cite{Kelly.1961}
\item mention Dowker duality
\item Mayer-Vietoris
\end{itemize}

\todo{Uli: I saw a discussion about the topological invariance of Vietoris homology for non-compact metric spaces.
I thought that it suggested that invariance holds only for compact spaces,
but I can't find it anymore. 

What I found was this:
